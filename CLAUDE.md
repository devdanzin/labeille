# CLAUDE.md — labeille development guide

## Project overview
labeille hunts CPython JIT bugs by running real-world PyPI package test suites against JIT-enabled builds.
Companion to [lafleur](https://github.com/devdanzin/lafleur) (evolutionary JIT fuzzer).

## Security note
labeille installs and runs arbitrary third-party code from PyPI. Never run batch operations on a machine with sensitive credentials or data. Use containers, VMs, or disposable cloud instances for batch runs. See README.md for detailed guidance.

## Environment
- The `.venv` was created with a JIT-enabled CPython build at `~/projects/jit_cpython/python`
- This build has AddressSanitizer (ASAN) enabled — always set `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0`
- The JIT has known bugs that crash dev tools (e.g. mypy) — always set `PYTHON_JIT=0` for dev commands
- Standard prefix for all dev commands: `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0 PYTHON_JIT=0`

## Dev commands
```bash
# Lint and format
ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0 PYTHON_JIT=0 .venv/bin/ruff format .
ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0 PYTHON_JIT=0 .venv/bin/ruff check .

# Type checking (strict mode, configured in pyproject.toml)
ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0 PYTHON_JIT=0 .venv/bin/mypy

# Tests (unittest, NOT pytest)
ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0 PYTHON_JIT=0 .venv/bin/python -m unittest discover tests -v
```

## Code style
- Python >=3.13, developed on 3.15
- src layout: `src/labeille/`
- ruff line-length: 99
- mypy strict mode
- Tests use `unittest` with `unittest.mock` — never pytest
- Click CLI framework — Click 8.3+ (no `mix_stderr` in CliRunner)

## Architecture
- `cli.py` — Click CLI entry point with `resolve`, `run`, `scan-deps`, `bisect`, `registry`, `analyze`, `bench`, `ft`, and `compat` subcommands
- `cli_utils.py` — Shared Click helpers (parse_csv_list, parse_env_pairs)
- `resolve.py` — PyPI metadata fetching, repo URL extraction, registry building
- `runner.py` — Clone repos, create venvs, run test suites, detect crashes
- `runner_models.py` — Runner data models (RunnerConfig, PackageResult, RunSummary)
- `repo_ops.py` — Git clone, checkout, sdist install operations
- `crash.py` — Crash detection from exit codes and stderr patterns
- `classifier.py` — Pure Python vs C extension classification from wheel tags
- `bisect.py` — Git bisection to find crash-introducing commits
- `compat.py` — C extension compatibility survey (build, classify failures)
- `compat_cli.py` — Compat CLI subcommands (survey, compare, report)
- `registry.py` — YAML registry I/O (reads from laruche registry or custom path)
- `registry_cli.py` — Batch registry management CLI (add/remove/rename/set fields, validate, migrate)
- `migrations.py` — Registry migration framework (named transformations with logging and dry-run)
- `registry_ops.py` — Batch operations with filtering, atomic writes, dry-run previews
- `analyze.py` — Data loading and analysis (run data, registry stats, comparison, flaky detection)
- `analyze_cli.py` — Analysis CLI (registry, run, compare, history, package subcommands)
- `formatting.py` — Shared text formatting (tables, histograms, sparklines, durations)
- `summary.py` — Run summary formatting (uses formatting.py)
- `scan_deps.py` — AST-based test dependency scanner
- `import_map.py` — Import name to pip package mapping (100+ entries)
- `yaml_lines.py` — Line-level YAML manipulation preserving formatting
- `io_utils.py` — Shared I/O utilities (atomic writes, JSON/YAML loading, process groups)
- `logging.py` — Structured logging setup
- `bench/` — Benchmarking subsystem (runner, config, results, stats, compare, display, export, anomaly, tracking, trends, timing, cache, constraints, system)
- `bench_cli.py` — Benchmark CLI subcommands (run, compare, export, track)
- `ft/` — Free-threading subsystem (runner, results, analysis, compare, display, export, compat)
- `ft_cli.py` — Free-threading CLI subcommands (run, compare, export, compat)

## Testing notes
- Integration tests mock `fetch_pypi_metadata` to avoid network calls
- Runner tests mock `subprocess.run` and `clone_repo` extensively
- 2145 tests total across 49 test files

## Enriching packages

The package registry lives in [laruche](https://github.com/devdanzin/laruche).
See laruche's README for the enrichment process, field schema, and rules.

Quick setup:
- `labeille registry sync` to fetch the registry
- Default location: `~/.local/share/labeille/registry/`
- `--registry-dir` overrides for any command

Registry batch operations (`labeille registry add-field`, `set-field`, etc.)
work on whichever directory `--registry-dir` points to.

## Performance and resource usage

### Parallel execution
- `--workers N` runs N packages in parallel (default: 1, sequential)
- Each worker spawns its own subprocesses (git, pip, pytest) — threads just wait on child processes, so the GIL is not a bottleneck
- Memory scales linearly with worker count; each test process uses the full interpreter + test suite + any ASAN overhead

### ASAN and resource pressure
- The dev .venv uses an ASAN-enabled build: ~2-3x memory per process
- For parallel runs with ASAN, --workers 2-3 is the practical limit
- For large batch runs (50+ packages), consider a non-ASAN JIT build: most JIT crashes (segfaults, aborts, assertion failures) reproduce identically without ASAN, and you can run --workers 4-8 comfortably
- Specific crashes can be reproduced under ASAN afterward for detailed memory error analysis

### Orphaned process cleanup
- labeille kills the entire process group on timeout (`os.killpg`), which catches most grandchild processes
- However, if you interrupt labeille itself (Ctrl+C), subprocesses may still survive — check with `ps aux | grep pytest` and clean up as needed

## Registry batch operations

- Default registry location: `~/.local/share/labeille/registry/` (override with `--registry-dir`).
- Always dry-run first (omit --apply), review the preview, then re-run with --apply.
- Use --lenient when resuming an interrupted operation or when you expect some files to already have the field.
- Use --after to control field placement in the YAML for readability.
- Run `labeille registry validate` after batch edits to catch issues.

## Registry migrations

- `labeille registry migrate --list` shows available migrations and their applied status.
- `labeille registry migrate <name>` previews changes (dry-run by default).
- `labeille registry migrate <name> --apply` applies changes and logs to `migrations.log` (lives in the laruche repo).
- Each migration runs once — re-application is blocked with the original date shown.
- Add new migrations by decorating a function with `@register_migration(name, description)` in `migrations.py`.

## Quick investigation overrides

These CLI options let you experiment without touching registry YAMLs:
- `--extra-deps "pkg1,pkg2"` — inject deps into every venv
- `--test-command-override "..."` — replace all test commands
- `--test-command-suffix "..."` — append flags to test commands
- `--repo-override "pkg=url"` — use a fork's repo (repeatable)
- `--packages=pkg@revision` — test at a specific git revision
- `--no-shallow` — full clone (needed for old revisions)

## Investigating a crash at a specific revision

If a crash was found at commit abc123:
1. Reproduce: `labeille run --packages=mypkg@abc123 --no-shallow ...`
2. Check if HEAD still crashes: `labeille run --packages=mypkg ...`
3. If HEAD doesn't crash, the package fixed the issue.
4. If HEAD still crashes, the issue persists — file upstream or investigate the JIT side.

## Workflow
- Use `/task-workflow <description>` for the full issue → branch → code → test → commit → PR → merge cycle
